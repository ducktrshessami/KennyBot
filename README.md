# KennyBot
### Personal Discord bot

Currently doesn't handle multiple servers because I never really intended to use my bot on multiple servers, but it wouldn't be too hard to add support from here.

The code for handling music is kinda messy, so I might redo that at some point.

## Setup
Just hit that `npm install` and fill in the necessary information in config.json

Default command prefix is either k! or an @mention
