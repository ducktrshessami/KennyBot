# kennybot

Another music/dice bot for Discord

### Features

- A music player frontend website
- Multiple playlists per server

- Miscellaneous features to make my life easier

# Disclaimer

I don't own any property associated with [The Walking Dead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walking_Dead_(video_game_series))

I originally named this bot "KennyBot" following an inside joke with some of my friends

# Usage/Deployment

This bot is deployed privately at [discord-kennybot](https://discord-kennybot.herokuapp.com/)

If this bot is in your server, use the help command for a command list:

```
@kennybot help
```

A proper public production deployment of this bot would require different presence, response, and config handling
